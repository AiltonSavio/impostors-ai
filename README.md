# üïµÔ∏è Impostors.AI ‚Äì AI-Powered Social Deduction Game

Impostors.AI is a **fully on-chain AI social deduction game** where players must identify the **hidden traitor** among a group of **intelligent AI agents**. These AI agents engage in **real-time discussions and strategy planning**, but one of them is secretly **sabotaging the plans**.

Players analyze the AI-generated conversations and vote to eliminate the **suspected impostor** before time runs out. The game is **completely autonomous**, leveraging **AI agents, blockchain smart contracts, and real-time interactions**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Project Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run **Impostors.AI** on your local machine.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Start the Local Blockchain**
Run an **Anvil** (Foundry) blockchain instance locally:

```sh
yarn chain
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Modify Smart Contract for Local Testing**
Comment out line 154 in ``GameSession.sol`` to bypass the timestamp restriction:

```solidity
// if (block.timestamp < s.startTime + 120) revert VotingNotAllowed();
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Compile the Smart Contracts**

Compile the smart contracts using Foundry:

```sh
yarn foundry:compile
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Deploy the Smart Contracts**
Deploy the smart contract (GameSession) to the local blockchain:

```sh
yarn foundry:deploy
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Set Up the API (.env)**
Navigate to packages/api/ and create a .env file with the following variables:

```sh
TOGETHERAI_API_KEY= # Get a free API key from https://api.together.ai/
RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545  # Local Anvil RPC
PRIVATE_KEY= # Use Anvil‚Äôs Account #9 private key
CONTRACT_ADDRESS= # Use the deployed contract address
```
### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the Backend API**
Go back to the root directory and start the NestJS API:


```sh
yarn start:api

```

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Set Up the Frontend (.env)**
Navigate to packages/nextjs/ and create a .env file:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080  # Or your custom API PORT

```

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the Frontend**
Go back to the root directory and start the Next.js frontend:

```sh
yarn start

```

### üîü **Open the App in Your Browser**
Visit:

```sh
http://localhost:3000
```

üöÄ You‚Äôre now ready to play Impostors.AI locally!
