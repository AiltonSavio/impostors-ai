# 🕵️ Impostors.AI – AI-Powered Social Deduction Game

Impostors.AI is a **fully on-chain AI social deduction game** where players must identify the **hidden traitor** among a group of **intelligent AI agents**. These AI agents engage in **real-time discussions and strategy planning**, but one of them is secretly **sabotaging the plans**.

Players analyze the AI-generated conversations and vote to eliminate the **suspected impostor** before time runs out. The game is **completely autonomous**, leveraging **AI agents, blockchain smart contracts, and real-time interactions**.
