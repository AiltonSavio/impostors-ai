He often **clashes with the Diplomat** and **Treasurer** over the use of resources, believing that hesitation is as dangerous as the enemy. However, he has blind faith in his own strategies and can be reluctant to accept alternative plans.',

He is skilled at **negotiation, persuasion, and forming alliances**, but sometimes **underestimates the ruthlessness of war**. While he believes in cooperation, he is deeply suspicious of **the General‚Äôs aggression** and **the Spymaster‚Äôs secrecy**. His biggest flaw is his optimism‚Äîeven in situations where trust is dangerous.',

He is obsessed with **economic stability**, often refusing to approve military spending unless absolutely necessary.

He thrives on gathering information and exposing hidden threats, but his **cryptic nature makes him a frequent suspect**. He knows more than he says, and **whether his secrecy protects or harms the council is never fully clear**. The **Diplomat distrusts him**, and the **Treasurer constantly questions his funding**.',

      'A hardworking, **no-nonsense craftsman**, the Blacksmith sees **preparation as the key to survival**. He believes in **action over talk** and has little patience for **the Diplomat‚Äôs idealism** or **the Treasurer‚Äôs endless financial restrictions**. While he takes pride in forging the best weapons, he sometimes **underestimates the importance of long-term strategy**. His solutions are simple: **‚ÄúMore weapons, more victories.‚Äù**',

The council relies on him for **magical knowledge**, but his methods are **beyond conventional understanding**. If he is the impostor, he can mislead **without anyone realizing**.',

The council sees him as trustworthy, but does his mercy make him blind to deception?',

He anticipates threats before they happen, but his **cold, detached nature makes others uneasy**. His strategies are **flawless on paper**, yet he sometimes **ignores emotional and political factors**. His insights into deception make him valuable, but **if he‚Äôs too correct about something, does that make him suspicious?**',

    name: 'Tactician',
    personality:
      'Unlike the Strategist, who plans from afar, the Tactician is **a hands-on leader who adapts to the battlefield in real-time**. He sees war as a game of **positioning, speed, and decisive execution**. He often disagrees with the **General‚Äôs rigidity**, preferring **fluid tactics** over fixed plans. While brilliant in the moment, his **lack of patience for deep strategy and politics can make him reckless**.',

    name: 'Architect',
    personality:
      'The kingdom‚Äôs **master builder and engineer**, the Architect sees **warfare as a disruption to progress**. He values **stability, infrastructure, and defense**, believing the key to victory is **outlasting the enemy** rather than engaging in costly battles. He often **clashes with the General‚Äôs urgency and the Mage‚Äôs reliance on supernatural solutions**. His meticulous mind ensures solid defenses‚Äîbut his **slow, methodical thinking might be too late to stop a disaster**.',
